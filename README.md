### hexagonal system
This program draws hexagonal coordinate system including such as:
- simple figures drawing (hexagons)
- advanced figures drawing (hexagon meshes (square and circle))
- colors in rgb
- coordinate system methods

Current tasks:
- Coordinate system:
- [x] hexagonal *(hex_x, hex_y)* to descartes *(x, y)* coordinate system
- [x] function returning connected hexagons (6 item list) to current
- [x] screen width and height parameter getter
- [x] coordinate centering function


- Graphic:
- [x] hexagon drawing function (with color parameter)
- [x] hexagon parameters getter
- [ ] hexagon drawing function (with image parameter)


- Advanced graphic:
- [x] function drawing squared hexagonal mesh
- [x] function drawing 'circled' hexagonal mesh
- [ ] function drawing current set of hexagons
